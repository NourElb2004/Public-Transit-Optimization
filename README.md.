# Public Transit Optimization

This project implements a transportation network optimization system using graph-based models and algorithmic techniques. The network is represented as a weighted graph, and multiple optimization algorithms are applied to improve infrastructure connectivity, routing efficiency, and public transit performance under traffic and demand constraints.

The system supports analysis of normal routing, peak-hour congestion, emergency scenarios, and public transit scheduling.

## Key Features
- Graph-based modeling of an urban transportation network
- Infrastructure optimization using Minimum Spanning Tree
- Traffic-aware shortest path routing
- Emergency routing using heuristic search
- Public transit optimization using dynamic programming

## Algorithms Used
- Prim’s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* Search
- Dynamic Programming

## Data
The system uses CSV files representing:
- Network nodes and facilities
- Existing and potential roads
- Metro lines and bus routes
- Public transit demand and traffic conditions

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NetworkX
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Folium

This project demonstrates the practical application of algorithmic optimization techniques to real-world transportation networks.
